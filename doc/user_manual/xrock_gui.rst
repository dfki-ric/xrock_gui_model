XRock GUI Model - Graphical user interface implementation for XRock models
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X-Rock-GUI `(xrock_gui)` displays components as nodes and allows to establish connections between
nodes by drawing edges in a graph view.
Users can manage components from different database types for both hardware and software and also export the final cnd file.

X-Rock-GUI is an open source software which can be found in the xrock gui `repository <https://github.com/dfki-ric/xrock_gui_model.git>`_.


Features
--------
- **CRUD Operations:** Manage your xtypes components databases with full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.
- **Visual Reconfiguration:** Reconfigure your system visually using an intuitive node and graph-based interface that allows you to seamlessly connect interfaces and components.
- **Import/Export Capability:** Import or export your final configuration as a .cnd file for deployment or further integration.
- **Multiple Database Support:** Integrate with various database types, including:

  - **Client:** For example, using a `jsondb server <https://github.com/dfki-ric/xdbi/blob/master/bin/jsondb.cpp>`
  - **Serverless:** Direct filesystem access.
  - **MultiDbClient:** Manage multiple databases concurrently by combining the capabilities of both Client and Serverless, allowing you to work with several database instances in a single interface.
- **Module Builder:** Build new xtype modules directly from the xrock gui.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Designed for flexible integration and easy extension to meet diverse project requirements.

Bundle Selection and Loading
----------------------------
If your bundle is already selected in your Autoproj workspace, you can click "Reset to Default". This action will load the XDBI configuration from your selected bundle.
If the bundle is not selected, a dialog will pop up allowing you to select the bundle. Please note, this will be a one-time operation, and you can only select your bundle at the first time. 

1. **Prepare xdbi Configuration Files for the Bundle :**  

   In the configuration directory of your rock bundle, create a subdirectory named **xdbi**. Inside this directory, create a file called **db_config.json** with a template similar to the one below. Adjust the values to suit your environment:



   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "MultiDbClient": {
          "main_server": {
            "name": "main_server (write)",
            "type": "Serverless",
            "path": "database/backboneref", 
            "graph": "graph_test"
          },
          "import_servers": [
            {
              "name": "myimportserver_1 (read)",
              "type": "Serverless",
              "path": "database/atomic_component_db",
              "graph": "main"
            },
            {
              "name": "myimportserver_2 (read)",
              "type": "Client",
              "url": "http://localhost:8183/",
              "graph": "master"
            }
          ]
        }
      }

   .. tip::

   Checking `Also lookup in main_server` will allow you look into the `main_server` alongside `import_servers`.

   .. tip::
      
   You can change the `main_server` from the Main Server selection box.

   .. important:: 

      `import_servers` are read-only databases, all updates will be written to the `main_server`.

2. **Finalize Configuration:**  
   After adjusting your MultiDbClient settings in the pop-up dialog, click the **Save and Close** button to apply and save the configuration.


Creating a New ComponentModel
=============================
To start building a new ComponentModel from scratch, click the **New Model** :ref:`new_model_figure` icon on the toolbar or choose the **New Model** action from the **Database** menu. This action opens a new tab view where you can begin adding components.

Once nodes are added to your view, you can create edge connections between their interfaces. The GUI automatically verifies whether the source node's interfaces and the destination node's interfaces are compatible for a connection. As you drag an edge, the node interface's rectangle is highlighted if the connection is feasible.

Configure a ComponentModel
--------------------------
This section describes how to load and modify an existing ComponentModel from the database.

Load Model
==========

To load a ComponentModel from the database, follow these steps:

- Click the **Load Model** :ref:`load_model_figure` icon action.
- Once loaded, the **ComponentModelWidget** will be populated with the model's properties.

.. image:: graphics/xrockGui/componentModelWidget.png
   :alt: CMWidget
   :align: center


Configure Node
==============

.. image:: graphics/xrockGui/configure_node.png
   :alt: ConfigureNodeMenu
   :align: center

To configure a node, first select the node you want to configure, 
then right click on it and click the **"configure node"** option. 
A dialog will appear where you can write your YAML
configuration. Once you close the dialog, 
you need to save the component model to the
database to apply the changes.

.. image:: graphics/xrockGui/configure_node_dialog.png
   :alt: ConfigureNodeDialog
   :align: center


Configure Edge
==============

.. image:: graphics/xrockGui/configure_edge_menu.png
   :alt: ConfigureEdgeMenu
   :align: center

To configure an edge (connection), first select the edge connection between two nodes you want to configure, 
then right click on it and click the **"configure edge"** option. 
A dialog will appear where you can write your YAML
configuration. Once you close the dialog, 
you need to save the component model to the
database to apply the changes.

.. image:: graphics/xrockGui/configure_edge.png
   :alt: ConfigureEdgeDialog
   :align: center


Decoupling
==========

If you need to decouple edges, you have two options:

.. image:: graphics/xrockGui/decouple.png
   :alt: Decouple
   :align: center

- **Decouple Selected:**  
  For single edge decoupling, go to the menu action **Edit â†’ Decouple Selected**.

- **Decouple Long Edges:**  
  To decouple multiple long edges at once, select **Edit â†’ Decouple Long Edges**. The system will automatically decouple long edges.

Toggling
========

Each node in the graph editor has multiple interfaces (input/output connections).  You can toggle these interfaces on or off to control which connections appear in the top-level component model.

Select a node in the graph editor, then
right click on the interface and select `toggle interface` to enable or disable specific interfaces.
The node will update immediately to reflect your changes.
When you add a node to a model, only the enabled interfaces will be visible and available for connections.

   :alt: Toggling
   :align: center


Renaming Nodes
==============

.. image:: graphics/xrockGui/alias_name.png
   :alt: AliasName
   :align: center

While the original name of a model is immutable, you can create an alias:

- Edit the node's name via the **NodeData Widget** :ref:`node_data_widget_figure`.
- The header of the node will then display the new alias.

Open Model
==========

.. image:: graphics/xrockGui/load.png
   :alt: AliasName
   :align: center

To open a specific model from the nodes view:

- Click the load model tool bar action :ref:`load_model_figure` 
- Right-click on the node you want to open and select **Open Model** from the context menu.
- This action opens the model in a new tab.
- You can also toggle the visibility of specific interfaces within the model by right-clicking on an interface and selecting **Toggle Interface**.
- After making the necessary changes, modify your model's properties in the **ComponentModelEditorWidget** and save back to the database by clicking the save icon.
- Optionally, you can save the model under a different version if you need to maintain multiple versions in the database.

Hardware - Software Link
========================

You can manage hardware links of a component model 
by clicking the *Manage Hadrware Links* button 
in the bottom right corner (see image below). 

.. image:: graphics/xrockGui/configured_for_dialog.png
